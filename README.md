UCLA Stats 101B - Introduction to Design and Analysis of Experiment

Final Project - Full Marks Recieved:

In this project, my team and I came up with a research question related to an online simulated population. We chose to look into the effect of caffeine and exercise on memory. We utilized blocking and various trials of different types of experimental design to determine which effect were significant and if any interaction effects were present. 

The .csv file contains the collected data from the online population. The .Rmd contains all of the code used in running the experiments and conducting analysis. The word document contains our final written report.
